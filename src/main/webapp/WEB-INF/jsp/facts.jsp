                                     <h4><b>1. Shepherds discovered coffee in Ethiopia circa 800 A.D.</b></h4>

<p>Legend has it that 9th century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating coffee berries. A local monk then made a drink with coffee berries and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee was born.
</p>
   <br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>2. Coffee is the second most traded commodity on earth.</b></h4>

<p>According to the Global Exchange, there are approximately 25 million farmers in over 50 countries involved in producing coffee. The number one commodity? Oil.
</p>
<br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>3. In Italian espresso means "when something is forced out."</b></h4>

<p>This refers to the way espresso is made — forcing boiling water through pressed coffee grounds. And, although espresso has more caffeine per volume than coffee, because it's consumed in smaller quantities, it actually has about a third of the amount of caffeine as a regular cup of coffee.
</p>
<br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>4. Coffee was the first food to be freeze-dried.</b></h4>

<p>The process of freeze drying — when fresh foods are placed in a dryer where temperatures drop to negative 40 degrees F — first started during World War II to preserve foods.
</p>
<br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>5. There are two types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta.</b></h4>

<p>Seventy percent of coffee beans are Arabica. Although less popular, Robusta is slightly more bitter and has twice as much caffeine.
</p><br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>6. Coffee is actually a fruit.</b></h4>

<p>Coffee beans as we know them are actually the pits of a cherry-like berry that are grown on bushes. Even though coffee is actually a seed, it's called a bean because of its resemblance to actual beans.
</p><br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>7. The world's most expensive coffee is $600 a pound.</b></h4>

<p>And it comes from the feces of a Sumatran wild cat. The animal — called a Luwak — is unable to digest coffee beans. In the process of digesting the beans, they are fermented in the stomach. When the beans are excreted, they produce a smooth, chocolaty coffee.
</p><br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>8. The majority of coffee is produced in Brazil.</b></h4>

<p>Brazil produces 40% of the world's coffee, which is twice as much as 2nd and 3rd place holders, Colombia and Vietnam.
</p><br/>   <br/>
<h4><b>9. Hawaii is the only state in the U.S. that commercially grows coffee.</b></h4>

<p>Kona coffee is the United States' gift to the coffee world. Because coffee grows best in climates along the equator, Hawaii's weather is optimal for harvesting coffee beans.
